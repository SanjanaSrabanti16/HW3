# HW3

This is a very simple Undo and Redo functionality using mobile device's sensor and motion.

For the basic undo and redo functionality I followed this link - https://codepen.io/kimwils/pen/zYYmrbO

To access device motion and sensor I followed this - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/Orientation_and_motion_data_explained, and https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DeviceOrientationEvent

To use this system on your mobile, just go to this github link - https://sanjanasrabanti16.github.io/HW3/, click the Request button and allow the access.
